## Motivation and Learning NextJS

This is my first blog post. My motivation for creating this blog is twofold: first to document my development journey and cement my learning, and second I'm hopeful that this will put my expertise on display in a way that could lead to additional opportunities in the future. The blog will mostly be me describing technical stuff I learn or run into, mixed with some personal rambling with regard to my job search.

## Some Technical Challenges on the Portfolio Project

I won’t dive too deep into the code here, but if you're curious, you can check out the repository: [github.com/JChase2/portfolio-v3](https://github.com/Jchase2/portfolio-v3)

Some of the trickier aspects I've run into so far involved how I wanted to structure the blog, if I wanted to go with a static site generator or some pre-built open source blogging platform, and how to get the routing right for some of my old projects in the public directory. I use Obsidian, which is a markdown based note taking app. I've been running a script on this server that generates a site based on the Obsidian markdown files and I've got that published at [notes.jamesdchase.com](https://notes.jamesdchase.com), so I figured it'd be best to implement my own blog with markdown and maybe port the obsidian notes inside of the next app at some point in the future as an alternative to the script.

Currently for the blog I'm using remark and remark-html to convert the markdown into html. I'm also using the tailwind prose plugin instead of a dedicated stylesheet for the
html. That way I don't really have to extend or reimplement the sites style for the blog. I also had to rewrite parts of the header to play well with the blog. At any rate, I'm pretty happy with how it has turned out so far. Won't be surprised if I get the itch to add more features down the line.

## Job Hunting

For the past few months, I’ve been working part-time as a tile contractor, but I’m eager to get back into tech. The job market lately has bee challenging for a lot of devs, but I’m sticking it out. I may end up taking a job in an adjascent field if need be, but I'm going to continue to code on my own for the love of the game anyway.

While I’m primarily looking for development roles, I’m also considering IT positions since I have strong Linux and general IT experience, though most of it has been in freelance and support roles rather than a corporate setting. I did work in Linux IT support for a hosting provider for some time, which gave me hands-on troubleshooting experience.

I’m also exploring structured career programs like mthree, which could be a good stepping stone. Relocation might be required, but it could be worthwhile. Additionally, with my recent AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification, I’m considering expanding my cloud expertise, as there may be opportunities in that space that align with my skills.

Regardless of where I end up, I’m staying positive and open to new possibilities.

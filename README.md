# Portfolio V3

This is the third version of my portfolio site, which is published at [https://jamesdchase.com](https://jamesdchase.com)

I have two previous versions of the portfolio, one was written with bootstrap, some JS, CSS and html, the second one was built on create-react-app, which is no longer supported.

The goal is to help market myself as a dev and document my tech journey as I learn new things and, hopefully, help others that run into the same problems I have along the way!

# Portfolio V3

This will be the third version of my portfolio site, which will eventually be published on jamesdchase.com

Currently my site is using create-react-app and is a pretty minimal page. I'm going to replace the page with a next app that will have my own blog and static site generator for Obsidian notes built in.

The goal is to help market myself as a dev and document my tech journey as I learn new things and, hopefully, help others that run into the same problems I have along the way!
